This is an implementation of 2-3 finger trees by Ralf Hinze and Ross
Paterson ( http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html ).
The variety of uses of this data structure by varying the monoid
implementation is impressive. However, be aware that the core
implementation, whilst it does obey the general O(log) performance
characteristics tends to result in large amounts of memory churn when
modifying the data structure. Thus simpler and more naive solutions,
even if less algorithmically efficient, are often faster. This could
be addressed by further tuning work.

find before writing this one) at:
